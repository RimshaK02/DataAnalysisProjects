# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my collection of data analysis projects! This repository showcases my work in data exploration, machine learning, and data visualization. Below are the key projects included:

## Projects

### 1. **Customer Segmentation with KMeans Clustering**
   - **Description**: This project focuses on segmenting mall customers based on purchasing behaviors using the KMeans clustering algorithm. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
   - **Key Concepts**: KMeans Clustering, Customer Segmentation, Data Preprocessing

### 2. **Amazon Sales Data Exploration (EDA)**
   - **Description**: An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on Amazon sales data to uncover insights about product trends, seasonal patterns, and factors affecting sales performance.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Key Concepts**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Visualizations

### 3. **Movie Recommendation Engine**
   - **Description**: A movie recommendation system built using collaborative filtering techniques. This system suggests movies based on user preferences and ratings.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
   - **Key Concepts**: Collaborative Filtering, Recommendation Systems, Data Preprocessing, KNN, SVD 

### 4. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Reduction**
   - **Description**: This project applies PCA using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction on image data, improving data efficiency and pattern recognition.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Numpy, Scikit-learn
   - **Key Concepts**: PCA, Dimensionality Reduction, SVD

### 5. **Least Squares Estimation on Dataset**
   - **Description**: This project involves creating a dataset consisting of black-and-white images of circles. The task is to estimate the radius and location of the ball based on the image using various Least Squares techniques.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, Numpy, Scipy
   - **Key Concepts**: Image Processing, Least Squares Estimation, Computer Vision
